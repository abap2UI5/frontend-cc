//                    app with the package as an npm dependency
//   fiori-elements/  a Fiori elements app for OData V4 with the control in a
//                    custom section of its object page. No BSP of it - a
//                    Fiori elements app needs its OData service, which the

//                    a Fiori elements app for OData V2 with the control in an
//                    extension of its object page, and in abap/ the RAP
//                    service it reads. Its BSP is on the branch rap, with the

//   card/            a UI Integration Card for SAP Build Work Zone that runs

//                    thirdparty/z2ui5/embed/, where `ui5 build` puts it in
